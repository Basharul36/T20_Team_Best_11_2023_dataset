Rakep Patel(c),Kenya,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,Right arm Offbreak,"One of Kenyan cricket's clutch of promising youngsters, Rakep Patel is an aggressive right-handed batsman and occasional offspinner. Patel's first outing for Kenya came on his first-class debut, aged 17, for Kenya Select XI against Westerns in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup competition. Patel started his career in the lower middle order, but has since moved up the order and his best ODI performance to date came as an opener when he cracked 92 to help seal a six-wicket win over Netherlands in Nairobi in February 2010. He had to pull out of Kenya's squad for their Intercontinental Cup game against Canada in August 2009 when his father passed away, and captain Maurice Ouma dedicated the victory in that game ""to my team-mate's dad"". Unafraid to play his shots when the situation warrants, Patel smashed 71 from just 29 balls, including eight sixes, in a 50-over match against Uganda in December 2009. But he is also developing as a batsman in the longer forms of the game, and his 87 helped Kenya chase down a target of 320 in their second innings in an Intercontinental Cup game against Netherlands in February 2010. As Kenya look to rebuild after a turbulent period and re-assert their status as the leading Associate nation, Patel could be an important part of their plans.

His first New Zealand call-up came in early 2018 for the T20 tri-series involving England and Australia. It was reward for a prolific 2017-18 white-ball season by the left-hander, who scored over 300 runs in the Super Smash and more than 400 in the one-day Ford Trophy. He also bowls part-time left-arm spin which he has been encouraged to continue to work on.

From a sporting family - his father was a goalkeeper at a decent level and his brother plays rugby and represented Ireland at cricket at age-group level - Adair also showed promise in rugby but committed to cricket having been offered a trial by Warwickshire in 2013. He has represented Ireland at age-group and A team level and claimed the wicket of Marcus Trescothick as his maiden victim in first-class cricket. He was released by Warwickshire at the end of the 2017 season and has since played for Northern Knights and Durham's second team.

Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering.","https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316568.png"

Rakep Patel,Kenya,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper Batter,Right arm Offbreak,"One of Kenyan cricket's clutch of promising youngsters, Rakep Patel is an aggressive right-handed batsman and occasional offspinner. Patel's first outing for Kenya came on his first-class debut, aged 17, for Kenya Select XI against Westerns in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup competition. Patel started his career in the lower middle order, but has since moved up the order and his best ODI performance to date came as an opener when he cracked 92 to help seal a six-wicket win over Netherlands in Nairobi in February 2010. He had to pull out of Kenya's squad for their Intercontinental Cup game against Canada in August 2009 when his father passed away, and captain Maurice Ouma dedicated the victory in that game ""to my team-mate's dad"". Unafraid to play his shots when the situation warrants, Patel smashed 71 from just 29 balls, including eight sixes, in a 50-over match against Uganda in December 2009. But he is also developing as a batsman in the longer forms of the game, and his 87 helped Kenya chase down a target of 320 in their second innings in an Intercontinental Cup game against Netherlands in February 2010. As Kenya look to rebuild after a turbulent period and re-assert their status as the leading Associate nation, Patel could be an important part of their plans.

Van der Dussen had also been part of South Africa A's tour to India earlier that year, and the accumulated effect of his experience in such a wide variety of conditions has made him a dynamic, adaptable batsman at the top of the order or in the middle.A naturally attacking batsman, van der Dussen has also been able to
translate his talents into long-format cricket and was top-scorer in South Africa's first-class domestic competition in 2017-18, as well as being Lions' vice-captain. But it was his success in cricket's shortest formats that made van der Dussen impossible to ignore.He was an integral part of the Vancouver Knights team that won the 2018 Global T20 Canada, after which he was recruited by St Kitts & Nevis Patriots in the Caribbean Premier League and capped the year by topping the batting charts with 469 runs at a strike rate of 138.75 in Jozi Stars' run to the inaugural Mzansi Super League title. Van der Dussen transitioned easily into international cricket, striking a fifty on T20I debut against Zimbabwe and following that up with 93 in his first ODI against Pakistan.Liam Brickhill","https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322070.png"

That won him selection for the Africa XI in the Afro-Asia Cup in June, but he struggled in two outings against India A in August, making three ducks in four innings.  He was nevertheless rewarded with selection for the full Kenya side in the Twenty20 World Championship.

That won him a one-year contract with Warwickshire, but he failed to make any impression.  He missed his next chance on the big stage when appendicitis ruled him out of the 2004 Champions Trophy, and he then joined the players' strike which followed before heading to South Africa to play club cricket.  His continued to struggle with his bowling, and in November 2005 he went to Australia for five weeks to spend time with Terry Jenner in a bid to recapture it.  That failed, and Obuya had to develop his batting and he now plays as a specialist batsman and a very good fielder.
