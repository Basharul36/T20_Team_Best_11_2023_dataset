    "description": "One of Kenyan cricket's clutch of promising youngsters, Rakep Patel is an aggressive right-handed batsman and occasional offspinner. Patel's first outing for Kenya came on his first-class debut, aged 17, for Kenya Select XI against Westerns in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup competition. Patel started his career in the lower middle order, but has since moved up the order and his best ODI performance to date came as an opener when he cracked 92 to help seal a six-wicket win over Netherlands in Nairobi in February 2010. He had to pull out of Kenya's squad for their Intercontinental Cup game against Canada in August 2009 when his father passed away, and captain Maurice Ouma dedicated the victory in that game \"to my team-mate's dad\". Unafraid to play his shots when the situation warrants, Patel smashed 71 from just 29 balls, including eight sixes, in a 50-over match against Uganda in December 2009. But he is also developing as a batsman in the longer forms of the game, and his 87 helped Kenya chase down a target of 320 in their second innings in an Intercontinental Cup game against Netherlands in February 2010. As Kenya look to rebuild after a turbulent period and re-assert their status as the leading Associate nation, Patel could be an important part of their plans.\nLiam Brickhill    ",

His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill",

In T20, especially, he has proven a hard man to get away, with subtle changes of pace and variations, including a wrong'un and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn. He's a (mullet-wearing) colourful character off the field, but in contrast, his bowling, focusing on control, is clinical.",

It was a worthy reward for several outstanding seasons with the Sydney Sixers in the BBL where he was one of the most prolific wicket-takers in the competition and specialised in the death overs. ",

Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career.",

No player in Test history had started with a bigger bang - Vinod Kambli had 796 runs after his own ninth innings - and not even Brook's anticlimactic tenth innings (run out without facing in England's thrilling one-run defeat at Wellington) could take the gloss off his achievement.

Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering.",

    "description": "One of Kenyan cricket's clutch of promising youngsters, Rakep Patel is an aggressive right-handed batsman and occasional offspinner. Patel's first outing for Kenya came on his first-class debut, aged 17, for Kenya Select XI against Westerns in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup competition. Patel started his career in the lower middle order, but has since moved up the order and his best ODI performance to date came as an opener when he cracked 92 to help seal a six-wicket win over Netherlands in Nairobi in February 2010. He had to pull out of Kenya's squad for their Intercontinental Cup game against Canada in August 2009 when his father passed away, and captain Maurice Ouma dedicated the victory in that game \"to my team-mate's dad\". Unafraid to play his shots when the situation warrants, Patel smashed 71 from just 29 balls, including eight sixes, in a 50-over match against Uganda in December 2009. But he is also developing as a batsman in the longer forms of the game, and his 87 helped Kenya chase down a target of 320 in their second innings in an Intercontinental Cup game against Netherlands in February 2010. As Kenya look to rebuild after a turbulent period and re-assert their status as the leading Associate nation, Patel could be an important part of their plans.\nLiam Brickhill    ",

He was born in Sydney and raised in Canberra but has made his career with Western Australia after there during the 2009 off-season. He made his first-class debut in 2011-12 but his breakthrough season was 2013-14, when he finished second only to Steve O'Keefe on the Sheffield Shield wicket tally with 40 victims at 22.70. That season earned him a call-up to the Australia A squad for their four-day matches against South Africa in the 2014 winter. ",

    "description": "Seeking opportunities wherever they might arise, Rassie van der Dussen had played cricket in South Africa, England, Ireland, Netherlands, Canada and the Caribbean before he finally caught the national selectors' eye and made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe in October 2018. Van der Dussen had also been part of South Africa A's tour to India earlier that year, and the accumulated effect of his experience in such a wide variety of conditions has made him a dynamic, adaptable batsman at the top of the order or in the middle.A naturally attacking batsman, van der Dussen has also been able to\ntranslate his talents into long-format cricket and was top-scorer in South Africa's first-class domestic competition in 2017-18, as well as being Lions' vice-captain. But it was his success in cricket's shortest formats that made van der Dussen impossible to ignore.He was an integral part of the Vancouver Knights team that won the 2018 Global T20 Canada, after which he was recruited by St Kitts & Nevis Patriots in the Caribbean Premier League and capped the year by topping the batting charts with 469 runs at a strike rate of 138.75 in Jozi Stars' run to the inaugural Mzansi Super League title. Van der Dussen transitioned easily into international cricket, striking a fifty on T20I debut against Zimbabwe and following that up with 93 in his first ODI against Pakistan.Liam Brickhill",

He represented Kenya at Under-17 level while still only 14, and in 2007 he was one of the successes of Kenya's participation in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup, scoring 386 runs at 38.60 including a maiden first-class hundred. That won him selection for the Africa XI in the Afro-Asia Cup in June, but he struggled in two outings against India A in August, making three ducks in four innings.  He was nevertheless rewarded with selection for the full Kenya side in the Twenty20 World Championship.\nMartin Williamson\n",

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. ",

That won him a one-year contract with Warwickshire, but he failed to make any impression.  He missed his next chance on the big stage when appendicitis ruled him out of the 2004 Champions Trophy, and he then joined the players' strike which followed before heading to South Africa to play club cricket.  His continued to struggle with his bowling, and in November 2005 he went to Australia for five weeks to spend time with Terry Jenner in a bid to recapture it.  That failed, and Obuya had to develop his batting and he now plays as a specialist batsman and a very good fielder.\nMartin Williamson February 2007\n",

He had an excellent tour of Australia with the U-19 team in 2009, smashing 154 off 111 balls in a one-dayer and ended the series as the leading run-getter.

He blazed away to an unbeaten 64 off 30 balls against a Bangladesh side playing its best cricket in 2016-17 to upstage them in a warm-up match just before the 2017 Champions Trophy. That innings wasn't a one-off for Ashraf, who has built a reputation for explosive hitting while batting with the tail; it especially impressed his mentor Tauseef Ahmed, who fast-tracked him to the international side.",
