But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often.

He made a century on ODI debut against UAE in 2015 having flown 20 hours following exams in New Zealand, but soon decided to throw his lot in with New Zealand and focused on his career with Auckland. His first New Zealand call-up came in early 2018 for the T20 tri-series involving England and Australia. It was reward for a prolific 2017-18 white-ball season by the left-hander, who scored over 300 runs in the Super Smash and more than 400 in the one-day Ford Trophy. He also bowls part-time left-arm spin which he has been encouraged to continue to work on. As a teenager he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing rugby in New Zealand but it did not stall his cricket career.

From a sporting family - his father was a goalkeeper at a decent level and his brother plays rugby and represented Ireland at cricket at age-group level - Adair also showed promise in rugby but committed to cricket having been offered a trial by Warwickshire in 2013. He has represented Ireland at age-group and A team level and claimed the wicket of Marcus Trescothick as his maiden victim in first-class cricket. He was released by Warwickshire at the end of the 2017 season and has since played for Northern Knights and Durham's second team.

He possesses a classical action and a fine yorker, which he showed by clean bowling Stuart Broad as he took a promising 3-72. However injuries and Scotland call-ups ensured he did not play again for Durham until the end of 2015. He made his Twenty20 International debut against Ireland on 19 June 2015, although no play was possible due to rain, and a List A debut followed against Nepal in the 2015-17 ICC World Cricket League Championship.

His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match.

Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016.

Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.
Leask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a ""feisty cricketer"". A scattering of T20 matches were his only outings in his debut season.

translate his talents into long-format cricket and was top-scorer in South Africa's first-class domestic competition in 2017-18, as well as being Lions' vice-captain. But it was his success in cricket's shortest formats that made van der Dussen impossible to ignore.He was an integral part of the Vancouver Knights team that won the 2018 Global T20 Canada, after which he was recruited by St Kitts & Nevis Patriots in the Caribbean Premier League and capped the year by topping the batting charts with 469 runs at a strike rate of 138.75 in Jozi Stars' run to the inaugural Mzansi Super League title. Van der Dussen transitioned easily into international cricket, striking a fifty on T20I debut against Zimbabwe and following that up with 93 in his first ODI against Pakistan.Liam Brickhill"

Patel's first outing for Kenya came on his first-class debut, aged 17, for Kenya Select XI against Westerns in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup competition. Patel started his career in the lower middle order, but has since moved up the order and his best ODI performance to date came as an opener when he cracked 92 to help seal a six-wicket win over Netherlands in Nairobi in February 2010. He had to pull out of Kenya's squad for their Intercontinental Cup game against Canada in August 2009 when his father passed away, and captain Maurice Ouma dedicated the victory in that game ""to my team-mate's dad"". Unafraid to play his shots when the situation warrants, Patel smashed 71 from just 29 balls, including eight sixes, in a 50-over match against Uganda in December 2009. But he is also developing as a batsman in the longer forms of the game, and his 87 helped Kenya chase down a target of 320 in their second innings in an Intercontinental Cup game against Netherlands in February 2010. As Kenya look to rebuild after a turbulent period and re-assert their status as the leading Associate nation, Patel could be an important part of their plans.

Nsubuga steered his team to victory in the World Cricket League final against Argentina three years later, starring with both bat and ball, and has since settled into his role as a senior player for Uganda across all formats.

He represented Kenya at Under-17 level while still only 14, and in 2007 he was one of the successes of Kenya's participation in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup, scoring 386 runs at 38.60 including a maiden first-class hundred. That won him selection for the Africa XI in the Afro-Asia Cup in June, but he struggled in two outings against India A in August, making three ducks in four innings.  He was nevertheless rewarded with selection for the full Kenya side in the Twenty20 World Championship.

Rakep Patel(c),Kenya,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"One of Kenyan cricket's clutch of promising youngsters, Rakep Patel is an aggressive right-handed batsman and occasional offspinner. Patel's first outing for Kenya came on his first-class debut, aged 17, for Kenya Select XI against Westerns in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup competition. Patel started his career in the lower middle order, but has since moved up the order and his best ODI performance to date came as an opener when he cracked 92 to help seal a six-wicket win over Netherlands in Nairobi in February 2010. He had to pull out of Kenya's squad for their Intercontinental Cup game against Canada in August 2009 when his father passed away, and captain Maurice Ouma dedicated the victory in that game ""to my team-mate's dad"". Unafraid to play his shots when the situation warrants, Patel smashed 71 from just 29 balls, including eight sixes, in a 50-over match against Uganda in December 2009. But he is also developing as a batsman in the longer forms of the game, and his 87 helped Kenya chase down a target of 320 in their second innings in an Intercontinental Cup game against Netherlands in February 2010. As Kenya look to rebuild after a turbulent period and re-assert their status as the leading Associate nation, Patel could be an important part of their plans.

While he had the leadership skills to captain his club team, Willow Cuts, to domestic honours in the 2006 Premier Two-Day League, Jones's occasional lapses of temperament have caused questions to be asked about his discipline and commitment. More of a batsman in his early youth, Jones has latterly focused on his bowling and his selection to the national side was based mainly on his skills in that area. He won the Best Young Player award at the end of Bermuda's domestic season in 2006 while his father, Olin, collected the award for best player. Jones made his senior one-day debut against Kenya in November 2006, playing at the World Cup and then joining Bermuda's Under-19 squad at the Under-19 World Cup in 2008. Part of Bermuda's squad for the Intercontinental Shield competition in 2009-10, Jones nevertheless struggled as his own performances mirrored that of his team.

He has been a standout performer for Griqualand West in the three-day provincial tournament since 2004-05, steering them to titles in that season and in 2007-08. He has captured at least 25 wickets in the tournament for four straight seasons since his debut. Despite that, a permanent place in the Eagles starting XI has proved elusive. Coetzee has had limited opportunities in the game's shortest format, but proved vital to Eagles' qualification to the inaugural Champions League Twenty20. In his first game of the 2009 Pro20 Series, the deciding leg of the semi-final against Warriors, he sent down a nerveless Superover to secure Eagles a finals berth and passage to India.
